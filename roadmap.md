# SaaS UI Accelerator Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for incremental delivery: complete one scoped item fully before starting the next.

## Current State

- Core sorting engine is implemented (`sortByRules`).
- Multi-format parsing and parse+sort APIs are implemented (`formatSupport`).
- Table engine with sortable headers, data formatting, and action column support is implemented (`tableComponent`).
- Facade aliases are implemented (`myComponent`).

## Roadmap Strategy

- Ship one feature at a time on short branches.
- Every feature must include API docs, tests, and examples before merge.
- Keep backward compatibility stable; use deprecation before breaking changes.

## Phases

## Comprehensive SaaS Component Backlog

These are the full target modules for a complete SaaS-ready library.

- Auth Kit: Sign in, sign up, forgot password, magic link, social login, MFA, session guard, role and permission guards, tenant-aware auth context.
- Billing Kit: Plans, checkout, customer portal launcher, usage metering helpers, invoice list, entitlement checks, trial management, upgrade and downgrade flows.
- Tenant and Org Kit: Organization switcher, invite members, team roles, seat management, workspace settings, tenant resolver, tenant-safe route guards.
- Data Grid Pro: Advanced filtering, faceted search, saved views, server-side pagination, column pinning, column visibility, row selection, bulk actions, CSV export, inline edit.
- Forms and Validation Kit: Schema-driven form builder, async validation, dependent fields, autosave drafts, dirty-state guards, error summary, file upload with retry.
- Workflow and Automation UI: Rule builder, trigger-action editor, cron scheduler UI, webhook tester, execution log viewer, retry and replay controls.
- Analytics and Dashboard Kit: KPI cards, time-series charts, cohort tables, funnel chart, retention chart, configurable dashboard layout with saved presets.
- Notifications and Inbox Kit: Toast system, in-app notification center, templates, delivery channels, preferences center, unread counters, actionable notifications.
- Admin and Ops Console Kit: Feature flags UI, user impersonation banner, audit timeline, system health panel, support tools, API key management.
- Onboarding and Adoption Kit: Guided tours, checklist widget, empty-state templates, contextual help panel, feedback widget, NPS and CSAT components.

## Foundation Tracks (Required Across All Phases)

- Design tokens and theming: Brand packs, semantic color tokens, density modes, RTL, dark/light, high-contrast, white-label support.
- Data and state primitives: Query hooks, cache adapters, optimistic updates, offline-friendly patterns, mutation state primitives.
- Access control primitives: Page, component, action, and field-level gates with tenant scoping.
- Error and resilience primitives: Error boundaries, retry wrappers, fallback views, skeletons, optimistic rollback helpers.
- Internationalization and localization: Message formatting, number and currency formatting, timezone-safe date handling, locale-aware sort and filter.
